Ore ta awai tsubasa
kimi wa sukoshi
Guns and roses
Jean to Dulic
as I command
the latter part
is still unknown
though song has been
sung long ago
Cheers applause

The second verse is verse of love
Where I believe I won't be proud
The thoughts I have are fairly pure
For my beloved I've ever got

Zamina mina eh eh
Zamina mina oh oh
Zamina mina sankalegua
I know ua ah ah
